/**
 * SyncManager Component
 * 
 * A dedicated synchronization service that handles automated data refresh
 * between local app state and cloud storage when authentication state changes.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Monitors authentication state transitions (login/logout/session restoration)
 * - Performs one-time data synchronization after successful authentication
 * - Coordinates parallel refresh of watchlist and watch history data
 * - Prevents duplicate sync operations through ref-based state tracking
 * - Handles both initial app launch sync and runtime auth state changes
 * - Provides comprehensive logging for debugging sync operations
 * 
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Dedicated sync logic separate from authentication provider
 * - Automatic data consistency without manual intervention
 * - Performance optimization through parallel API calls
 * - Robust duplicate prevention and error handling
 * - Clean separation of concerns for data synchronization
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This component should be rendered once at the app root level alongside
 * the authentication provider to ensure comprehensive sync coverage.
 * 
 * Note: This component addresses the critical issue where user data isn't
 * immediately available after login, ensuring seamless user experience.
