# TODO (Next update)

1. ✅ Version handler, to support auto updates reminder while startup of app
2. ✅ Alert Box: Light to Dark which complements overall app UI
3. ✅ Revamping `more.tsx` page for better user accesibility with specialized `watchhistory` section at the top
4. Correcting `watchlist.tsx` page `card` sizes for dynamic accesibility
5. Changing logic of `DownloadManager` to support both browser level download and local app integrated downloads
6. App integrated download action dialogue should be dynamically handled using a button below/above the cross of the `DownloadedItems` cards
7. In `Details` page the description first line should be the full title as sometimes the title is too big and it overflows
8. In `watchlist.tsx` file when empty there should exist the sync button such that if initial sync failed, manual syncing can be done
9. The `carousel` in `explore.tsx` file should be infinity scrolling instead of going back at the end of all cards
10. Push Notification from time to time based off on a JSON file in repo even when the app is idle (experimental, may never see the light of day)
