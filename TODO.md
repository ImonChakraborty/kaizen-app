# TODO (Next update)

1. ✅ Navigation bar should be according to the overall app theme
2. ✅ The player buffer loader should not make the background darker
3. ✅ Revamp entire watch history cloud sync architecture such that it doesnt bleed appwrite dry anymore
4. ✅ Making the buffer loader duration lower by reducing the amount of buffer it shows for
5. Push Notification from time to time based off on a JSON file in repo even when the app is idle (experimental, may never see the light of day)
